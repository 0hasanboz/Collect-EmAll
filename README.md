**Game Flow and State Management**

1. **GameInstaller Class**:
   - The `GameInstaller` class serves as the main configurator of the game, handling necessary setups at the beginning and end.
   - The `Awake()` method creates and prepares required components before the game starts.
   - The `Start()` method activates the `AppState` when the game begins.
   - The `Update()` method ensures the updating of the `AppState` in every update loop.
   - The `OnApplicationQuit()` method performs cleanup operations when the application is closed.

2. **AppState Class**:
   - `AppState` serves as the main state machine of the game, managing different states such as loading, lobby, and game.
   - It manages three sub-states: `LoadingState`, `LobbyState`, and `GameState`.
   - `LoadingState` displays a loading screen while the game is loading.
   - `LobbyState` allows the player to navigate in the lobby interface and perform actions like starting levels.
   - `GameState` manages the main gameplay flow and controls sub-states like `PrepareGameState`, `InGameState`, `LevelCompleteState`, and `LevelFailState`.

3. **InGameState Class**:
   - `InGameState` manages the core gameplay state, enabling player interaction within the game environment.
   - It handles sub-states like `IdleState`, `OnMouseDownState`, and `OnMouseUpState`.
   - Sub-states processing mouse interactions handle player actions based on mouse clicks.

4. **LevelCompleteState and LevelFailState Classes**:
   - These classes manage the completion or failure states of the game.
   - `LevelCompleteState` provides feedback to the player upon level completion and offers options to proceed to the next step.
   - `LevelFailState` provides feedback to the player upon level failure and offers options to retry or return to the lobby.

These steps summarize the main flow of the game and transitions between states. Additional sub-states and functionalities can be added to this structure to accommodate specific features or states of the game. However, the outlined structure provides a sufficient framework for understanding the general flow of the game.

**ComponentContainer Class and Dependency Management**

1. **ComponentContainer Class**:
   - `ComponentContainer` is a class responsible for managing components used within the game.
   - It enables adding, resolving, and managing various components within the game.
   - The `AddComponent()` method adds a specific component and implements relevant interfaces, typically `IInitializable`, `IStartable`, `IUpdatable`, and `IDisposable`.
   - The `Resolve()` method adds a component that has not been added yet.
   - The `GetComponent()` method retrieves a component of a specific type.
   - Methods like `InitializeComponents()`, `StartComponents()`, `Update()`, and `Dispose()` handle the initialization, updating, and cleaning up of components, respectively.

2. **Dependency Management**:
   - `ComponentContainer` manages dependencies, handling situations where different components are interdependent.
   - Each component specifies when it should be initialized, updated, or disposed of by implementing relevant interfaces.
   - This structure manages dependencies between components, facilitating interaction between classes.
   - Functions such as automatic initialization, updating, and disposal of components are centrally managed through this structure.

This class is used to manage dependencies between components within the game and ensure proper initialization, updating, and disposal of components. This enhances the overall performance of the game and reduces code repetition.

**StateMachine Class and State Management**

1. **StateMachine Class**:
   - `StateMachine` is an abstract class responsible for managing states within the game.
   - It controls transitions between states and manages entry, update, and exit operations for each state.
   - The `Enter()`, `Update()`, and `Exit()` methods handle the initialization, updating, and termination of states, respectively.
   - The `AddTransition()` method adds a transition from one state to another based on a trigger in a specific state.
   - The `AddSubState()` method adds sub-states and defines a default sub-state.
   - The `SendTrigger()` method sends a request for a state change using a specific trigger.

2. **State Management**:
   - `StateMachine` provides a hierarchical structure for states, where each state can have one or more sub-states.
   - Transitions between states are defined using triggers and target states.
   - Each state manages entry, update, and exit operations, which are fundamental functions for managing the game state.
   - States can be customized by implementing abstract methods like `OnEnter()`, `OnUpdate()`, and `OnExit()`.
   - Transitions between states control relationships between states and manage the flow of the game. This is essential for managing transitions between different sections of the game.

This class is used to manage different states (e.g., loading, lobby, game) within the game. Each state represents a specific section of the game and controls functions and transitions within that section. It is a powerful tool for organizing the overall flow of the game.
